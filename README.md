# Jupyter_OpenModelica_Kernel
An OpenModelica Kernel for Jupyter Notebook. 
All commands are interpreted by OMPython which communicates with OpenModelica Compiler and the result is presented to user.

This requires [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html), [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org), and [OMPython](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMPython) to be installed.  
Make sure the environment variable for OpenModelica is set e.g.:  
`OPENMODELICAHOME=C:/OpenModelica1.11.0-64bit/` or similar.  

To install:

     1) clone the project
     2) cd jupyter-openmodelica
     3) python setup.py install

To use it, run:

      jupyter notebook
      # In the notebook interface, select OpenModelica from the 'New' menu

The repository also contains the [example notebook file OpenModelica.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenModelica/jupyter-openmodelica/blob/master/OpenModelica.ipynb).

#### A note about plotting:
The plotting is done with the help of Dygraph javascript. If plot does not works, make sure 
the "dygraph-combined.js" is in the current working directory.
